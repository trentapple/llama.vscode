## Installation

### VS Code extension setup

Install the [llama-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ggml-org.llama-vscode) extension from the VS Code extension marketplace:

### llama.cpp setup

The plugin requires a [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server instance to be running at the configured endpoint:

#### Mac OS

```bash
brew install llama.cpp
```

> [!TIP]
> For extra performance, disable the GPU's wired memory collector (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/10119)

```bash
sudo sysctl iogpu.disable_wired_collector=1
```

#### Any other OS

Either use the [latest binaries](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases) or [build llama.cpp from source](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md). For more information how to run the `llama.cpp` server, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vscode/wiki).

### llama.cpp settings

Here are recommended settings, depending on the amount of VRAM that you have:

- More than 16GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server \
      -hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Q8_0-GGUF \
      --port 8012 -ngl 99 -fa -ub 1024 -b 1024 -dt 0.1 \
      --ctx-size 0 --cache-reuse 256
  ```

- Less than 16GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server \
      -hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Q8_0-GGUF \
      --port 8012 -ngl 99 -fa -ub 1024 -b 1024 -dt 0.1 \
      --ctx-size 0 --cache-reuse 256
  ```

- Less than 8GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server \
      -hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Q8_0-GGUF \
      --port 8012 -ngl 99 -fa -ub 1024 -b 1024 -dt 0.1 \
      --ctx-size 0 --cache-reuse 256
  ```

You can use any other FIM-compatible model that your system can handle. By default, the models downloaded with the `-hf` flag are stored in:

- Mac OS: `~/Library/Caches/llama.cpp/`
- Linux: `~/.cache/llama.cpp`
- Windows: `LOCALAPPDATA`

### Recommended LLMs

The plugin requires FIM-compatible models: [HF collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ggml-org/llamavim-6720fece33898ac10544ecf9)

## Examples

## Implementation details

The extension aims to be very simple and lightweight and at the same time to provide high-quality and performant local FIM completions, even on consumer-grade hardware.

- The initial implementation was done by Ivaylo Gardev [@igardev](https://github.com/igardev) using the [llama.vim](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vim) plugin as a reference
